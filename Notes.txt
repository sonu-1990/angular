template / templateUrl
component -> view(template) (interpolation {{}} / property binding [])
view(template) -> component (Event Binding () / Two-binding [()])
ng generate component --spec=false(dont need a testing file) --is(inetranl style)

What is the difference betweeen interpolation and property binding
when you want to deal value which is never changed during runtime you need to use 
interpolation 
but if you want to change something during runtime then you must use property
binding
